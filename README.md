# sparta-openweather-api-test

## The brief

 The objective was to build a program that could peform various services against an API.

### What I struggled with

I struggled to get random city names to be generated within my test files. An error message which I did not understand kept occurring.

Another issue was that none of my service files in the multiple directory worked. Once again, I did not understand the error message that I was getting , despite checking it on google.


### What went well

I managed to write successful tests for all of my single entry services
